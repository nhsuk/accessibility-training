# Introduction

This exercise is based on a fictional NHS service website which uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system). The design system is based on the research and experience of many NHS digital teams and adheres to accessibility guidelines.

However accessibility issues can be introduced if the design system is misused, misunderstood or not implemented correctly.

## How to use this site

This site contains several accessibility issues. The idea is to find as many of them as you can.

Read the [testing notes](https://nhs-accessibility-training.onrender.com/service/testing-notes) first to get you started on how you can test for accessibility issues.

There is an [answers](https://nhs-accessibility-training.onrender.com/service/answers) page indicating all the accessibility issue. Please try to go through the site first before looking at the answers!

There is also an [answerless version of this site](https://nhs-accessibility-excercise.onrender.com/) that can be used as a training excercise to prevent users from finding the answers.

## How to run this site locally

## Thanks

This testing site is inspired by the ['Training people to do accessibility reviews'](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/) blog article by Beverley Newing at the Ministry of Justice. This site is based on the ['Record a goose sighting'](https://record-a-goose-sighting.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) fictional service they created.
