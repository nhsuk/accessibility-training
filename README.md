# Introduction

This exercise is based on a fictional NHS service website which uses the [NHS design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system). The design system is based on the research and experience of many NHS digital teams and adheres to accessibility guidelines.

However accessibility issues can be introduced if the design system is misused, misunderstood or not implemented correctly.

## How to use this site

This site contains several accessibility issues. The idea is to find as many of them as you can.

Read the [testing notes](https://nhs-accessibility-excercise.onrender.com/service/testing-notes) first to get you started on how you can test for accessibility issues.

## How to run this site locally

This site is built using the [NHS.UK prototype kit](http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs)</a>.

To run it locally:

- clone this repository or download it as a zip
- at a command line, enter the directory and then run `npm install`
- run `npm run watch`

The site should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Thanks

This testing site is inspired by the ['Training people to do accessibility reviews'](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2020/01/14/training-people-to-do-accessibility-reviews/) blog article by Beverley Newing at the Ministry of Justice. This site is based on the ['Record a goose sighting'](https://record-a-goose-sighting.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) fictional service they created.
