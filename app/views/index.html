      <h1>Accessibility training exercise</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This exercise is based on a a fictional NHS service website which uses the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system">NHS design system</a>. The design system is based on the research and experience of many NHS digital teams and adheres to accessibility guidelines.</p>

      <p>However accessibility issues can be introduced if the design system is misused, misunderstood or not implemented correctly.</p>

      <p>This site contains several accessibility issues. The idea is to find as many of them as you can.</p>

      <h2>"Register for a service" fictional site</h2>

      <p>Read the <a href="/service/testing-notes">testing notes</a> first to get you started on how you can test for accessibility issues.</p>

      <p>There is also an <a href="/service/answers">answers</a> page indicating all the accessibility issue. Please try to go throught the site first before looking at the answers!</p>

      <p>No details you enter are kept or sent anywhere.</p>

      <p>There are 7 pages in this fictional service:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Start page</li>
        <li>What is your name?</li>
        <li>What is your date of birth?</li>
        <li>Do you know your NHS number</li>
        <li>Have you had any of these conditions?</li>
        <li>Check your answers</li>
        <li>Registration complete</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Accessibility issues start on the next 'Start' page.</p>

      <p class="nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-0"><a class="nhsuk-button" href="/service/start-page">Continue</a></p>
