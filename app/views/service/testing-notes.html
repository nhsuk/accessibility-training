      <h1>Testing notes</h1>

      <p>To help find accessibility issues you could use the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE browser extension</a>, which is available for Chrome, Firefox or Microsoft Edge.</p>
      <p>Please note that WAVE, as with other automated evaluation tools, will not find all the accessibility issues on a web page. They can only test some of the accessibility requirements that do not need human intervention. Manual testing by humans must be done to ensure an accessible user experience.</p>

      <h2>Testing checklist</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Does WAVE find any errors?</li>
        <li>Do <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#set-page-titles">page titles</a> make sense?</li>
        <li>Are <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#use-headings-correctly">headings</a> used correctly?</li>
        <li>Can you access everything using the <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#check-keyboard-accessibility">keyboard</a>?</li>
        <li>Are <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#label-form-fields-clearly">form fields</a> labeled correctly?</li>
        <li>Are there any <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#check-colour-contrast">colour contrast</a> errors or <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing#do-not-rely-on-colour-or-position-alone">reliance on colour alone?</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The NHS Digital service manual has further <a href="https://service-manual.nhs.uk/accessibility/testing">guidance on accessibility testing</a> which you could refer to for more checks.</p>
